# Florida Real Estate Licensee Extractor

### Hi everyone, I'm Brian from [BrianGalvan.com](http://briangalvan.com) 👋

I created this licensee extractor to mine new real estate agents and format the data so we can create our own mailers in Florida.

The State of Florida provides free data on licensed professionals, but the data comes in a massive RAW format that can be cumbersome to work with.

As a marketer who develops marketing support tools, processes, procedures, and strategic thinking, I wanted a way to grab the CSV files, upload them, and have a program magically find and format the data I need.

This tool automates that process. It takes the raw state file, filters for **brand new Sales Associates** (excluding corporations and branch offices), and outputs a clean Excel file ready for mailing labels.

This project can be easily forked and adapted to your specific needs.

## 🚀 Features

* **Automated Filtering:** Instantly separates "Sales Associates" from corporations, branch offices, and brokers.
* **Date Targeting:** Configurable "lookback" window (default: last 30 days) to find only the newest agents.
* **Data Cleaning:** Removes invalid statuses (expired, null/void) and keeps only "Current" licensees.
* **Mailing Ready:** Formats names and addresses into Title Case (e.g., "JOHN DOE" becomes "John Doe") so they look professional on envelopes.
* **Excel Output:** Generates a `.csv` file ready for mail merge or CRM import.
